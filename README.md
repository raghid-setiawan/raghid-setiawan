# 💫 About Me
**Cybersecurity, Bug Hunting, Reverse Engineering, AI & Business**  
From 🇮🇩 Indonesia

I am slowly building my personal presence through GitHub and Instagram by sharing what I learn and contributing when possible.  
Most of my daily work involves experimenting, configuring, and running simple systems while learning along the way.

I focus on gaining experience through Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDP), reconnaissance, and OSINT.  
My approach is simple: gain experience first, learn from mistakes, and grow step by step.

👯 **Looking to Collaborate On**  
I am open to suggestions and simple collaborations.
